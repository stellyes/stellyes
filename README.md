I'm most comfortable with back-end development as it concerns web applications and some local applications. I spent a year with a company located in Camarillo, CA learning and developing software solutions using the AWS platform. My specialties mostly pertain to web-crawling (Selenium), data-collection, CI/CD through AWS Amplify, and REST-ful API Development through AWS API Gateway v2. I am especially excited to continue developing my skills with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and be able to confidently be a full-stack developer.
